Based on an idea a friend had that we should rate sluchim or chabad emisaries which go to diffrent communities and teach and provide jewish
servises. Rabbinic students usually go do volonteer work at diffrent sluchin or chabad houses over break for a little break and practice.
Allthough they don't get paid some provisions like a bed to sleep on, food and a car and money for anything else is expexted. Also Some sluchim are harder to
deal with then others. Some sluchim are a pleasure to deal with but some treat there volonteers like garbage.A lot of times these volonteers don't
know what they are getting into and get stuck for sometimes four weeks with a bad conditions and come out feeling bitter.
Therefore this app is meant to rate the sluchim so the volnteers could write a comment about there stay so others would know about there
exsperience and decide if the jobs for them. This also makes the sluchim treat there volonteers better for they know that if they act bad every
one would know and no one would volonteer.
